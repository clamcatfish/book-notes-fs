    "description": "Learning to cope with discomfort--disagreement, aggression, and criticism (even wholly unprovoked aggression and criticism)--can be one of the greatest accomplishments of a child's early school years. Robert Reich, who was among other things President Bill Clinton's undersecretary of labor, attributes much of his personal development and even his later professional success to being bullied as a child. ... Reich set about finding ways to offset it. He developed his intellect, for one thing, and formed alliances with larger boys who were willing to protect him. Ultimately, being pushed around on the playground shaped Reich in a deep and lasting way, helping to strengthen his resolve to persevere and overcome. To make something of himself.",

His mantra was \"A genius is not born, but is educated and trained.\" Laszlo believed tin this idea so strongly that he wanted to test it with his own children-- Laszlo decided chess would be a suitable field for the experiment, and he laid out a plan to raise his children to become chess prodigies. The kids would be home-schooled, a rarity in Hungary at the time. The house would be filled with chess books and pictures of famous chess players. The children would play against each other constantly and compete in the best tournaments they could find. Their lives would be dedicated to chess. Susan, the oldest began playing chess when she was four years old. Within six months, she was defeating adults. Sofia. the middle child, did even better. By fourteen she was a world champion, and a few years later, she became a grandmaster. Judit, the youngest, was the best of all. By age five, she could beat her father. At twelve, she was the youngest player ever listed among the top one hundred chess players in the world. At fifteen years and four months old, she became the youngest grandmaster of all time ... For twenty-seven years, she was the number-one-ranked female chess players in the world.",

Early on, it's all sacrifice... It's only a months later that it becomes easier to exercises for its own sake. In the beginning, you need a reason to stay on track. This is why immediate rewards are essential. They keep you excited while the delayed rewards accumulate in the background. Immediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when dealing with habits of avoidance, which are behaviors you want to stop doing. It can be challenging to stick with habits like \"no frivolous purchases\" or \"no alcohol this month\" because nothing happens when you skip happy hour drinks or don't buy that pair of shoes. It can be hard to feel satisfied when there is no action in the first place. All you're doing is resisting temptation, and there isn't much satisfying about that. Open a savings account and label it for something you want--maybe \"Leather Jacket.\" Whenever you pass on a purchase, put the same amount of money in the account. Skip your morning latte? Transfer $5. It's like creating a loyalty program for yourself. The immediate reward of seeing yourself save money toward the leather jacket feels a lot better than being deprived.

Mindfulness helps break down the craving into transient bodily sensations. \"I'm going to go crazy if I can't have a cigarette\" becomes \"I notice a feeling of tightness, tension, restlessness.\" If we focus on the \"bite-sized pieces of experiences,\" Brewer explains, it's possible to manage moment to moment and \"surf\" a craving so we're not \"clobbered by this huge, scary\" wave. We don't have to rely on cognition to stop ourselves from reaching for a smoke because that wave gets weaker and weaker the harder we stare at it, until it loses the power to drag us under. And every time we don't get dragged under, that trigger loses its potency. We rewire our brain's response to the thing we crave.

    "description": "the 1989 San Francisco earthquake found that those who ruminated experienced more symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Similarly, a study of 455 people whose family members had died after terminal illnesses showed that those who ruminated were more likely to become depressed, and eighteen months later, most were still depressed. ... the mere act of rumination makes them feel worse, according to a plethora of studies. When people are given an emotionally neutral statement, such as \"Think about the level of motivation you feel right now,\" or \"Think about the long-term goals you have set,\" then are asked to focus on their feeling about it for eight minutes, those who are prone to ruminate feel worse at the end of the exercise, while people who don't ruminate feel the same way they did when they began, By contrast, when researchers instruct people to spend some time thinking about the blades of a fan or the layout of their local mall, ruminators feel better afterward--they've been distracted--while non-ruminators feel just the same. But ruminating is in fact a way of spinning your wheels and wasting time. The more you spin, the more stuck you get--and the deeper your rut becomes. Dwelling on a problem seems to impair our ability to solve it in some fundamental way, researchers believe. And according to the late Susan Nolen-Hoeksema, a Yale University expert on the topic, \"Even when a person prone to rumination comes up with a potential solution to a significant problem, the rumination itself may induce a level of uncertainty and immobilization that makes it hard for them to move forward.\" Deliberately replacing unpleasant, ruminative thoughts with ones that don't cause stress is the foundation of cognitive behaviour therapy, which is one of the most effective treatments for helping people change persistently negative thought patterns. More proof that mind over matter works. Ignoring naysayers is the kind of common sense our parents urged on us, though it's difficult to do. Criticism stings; being disliked doesn't feel good. But Linda Hasenfratz found that by treating the criticism as constructive and ignoring anything that was personal, she was able to turn it into a strength. And ultimately she proved to those naysayers that she was right for the job. By leaning away from discomfort, she decreased her own experience of it so she could focus on what was really important to her: changing to become the kind of leader the company needed--the kind who could successfully steer it to growth and expansion.",

After a lifetime of success, public humiliation must have been a searing trial. The desire to rant to pundits or write a tell all, McChrystal admitted, was overpowering. But with his wife's support, he made a deliberate decision not to define himself through his departure, or let others do so either. When discomfort is acute, it can trigger a fight-or-flight instinct, but for McChrystal--and Jessica Watkin--it never felt right to hide under the covers or unleash his anger at the world (or himself). That didn't provide a way forward. Instead, discomfort became a prompt to look inward and ask some very mindful questions: Who am I, now that the place I once occupied in the world is closed to me forever? And who would I like to be? When change occasions a loss of identity, whether that identity is \"greatest fighting force in the world\" or respected four-star general,\" reinvention is the path that provides the greatest sense of control, as Jessica Watkin found.",

    "description": "Few people can tune out the discomfort of anxiety. \"As soon as we get anxious or fear failure, we have no chance of getting into the expert state. It's just the wrong direction,\" Berka says. But her hunch was that if the high-strung novices could short-circuit their anxiety, they would learn faster. So they were given a little device to wear on their collars that buzzed in concert with their heart rate--until their brains approached the \"expert state,\" at which point the buzzing stopped. Just slowing their breathing--and being rewarded by reduced buzzing--moved the anxious novices closer to an expert state: their brains showed an increase of alpha frequency. In just one day, 85 percent of the participants were able to achieve a measure of control over their heart rate and move their brain activity closer to the expert state. In so doing, their accuracy at target practice also shot up significantly. \"We were happily surprised by that,\" Berka says. \"We thought we could help people control their brains, but that it could happen in one day was surprising. The neuro-feedback training enhanced their ability to get the perfect shot.\" The next day. the novices moved from a bow and arrow to a laser-shot rifle. Now that they knew what the expert state felt like, most of them could return to it without the help of the buzzer. \"Though we aren't normally conscious of our heart rate or the state of our brains, we can easily be made conscious of them,\" explains Berka. \"Once there is an association--taking a perfect shot and feeling that state--you have established, we think, a new neural pathway.\" While hitting the bull's-eye also provides positive reinforcement, Berka says the good feeling of being in the expert state is really all the inducement most people need. Once that connection was made, participants came up with their own cues to get back to that feeling; they found their own \"trigger switch\" to return to that state of mind. The experts had described a similar kind of switch, saying they could simply flip it on, take the shot, and then flip it off again. Did the novices become expert marksmen? No. But they did learn much faster--more than twice as fast, in fact--than they would have otherwise. Berka's hunch turned out to be right: if you can quiet your anxiety and learn to mirror the state of an expert's brain, you can progress much faster. And apparently, the neuro-feedback had lasting effects. A month later, 50 percent of the novices had fully retained their ability to induce the expert brain state. Several things struck me about this research. First it's revealing that anxiety really is the enemy of progress and basically shuts the gate on learning. The problem isn't discomfort with challenge and change, but how we respond to and manage--or don't manage--it. If the response is to freak out, discomfort becomes a real obstacle to growth and development; if the response is to calm ourselves--via mindfulness, meditation, tuning down the dial, or focusing on optimism--we have a better shot of figuring out how to get past an obstacle or master a challenge.",

    "description": "Pokroy likes to use as an analogy the children's story about the princess and the frog prince who retrieves her golden ball for her. Most of us will remember the story from childhood, but Pokroy attaches a whole new meaning to it. The princess in the story represents us, he explains, and her beloved golden ball is the status quo, or our comfort zone. When she loses the ball down a deep well, a frog offers to get it back for her, but only if he can live with her in the castle forever after. The frog represents change, Pokroy says, and like the princess in the story, we find change repellent. So desperate is she to get her ball back, however, that the princess grudgingly accepts the change. Really grudgingly! For some time, she is disgusted by the frog even as she fulfils her promise to him. But gradually she accepts him, and one day she embraces him and kisses him affectionately. Out pops a handsome prince. The analogy is obvious--when we overcome our discomfort with (or even aversion to) change, the reward will follow.... We don't change our behaviour by focusing on the behaviour alone. It requires a shift in attitude or mindset. And that forces us to really think about our actions (make them conscious, (which in turn will help us understand them better, or give us insight into them. Only then can we change the way se see them.... But making the unconscious conscious isn't easy. Because we are fearful of uncertainty--our brains dislike ambiguity intensely--we cling to the status quo, or our golden ball. The secret is to be aware of that weakness, observe where it affects us, and then stop.... But change, like the handsome prince in the children's story, is a powerful reward. And as we learn that letting go of our comfort, and first tolerating and then embracing the discomfort, will bring us great rewards, it becomes easier to do.",
    "comments": "The princess asked the frog for a favor. And the frog got to stay in the castle in return. The princess hated the frog (change). Eventually, she kisses the frog affectionately, and the frog becomes a prince.

    "description": "There are two ways to look at any task. You can do something because you see it as a way to end up better off than you are now-as an achievement or accomplishment. As in. \"If I complete this project successfully I will impress my boss,\" or \"If I work out regularly, I will look amazing.\" Psychologists call this a promotion focus, and research shows that when you are motivated by the thought of making gains, and you work best when you feel eager and optimistic. Sounds good, doesn't it? Well, if you are afraid you will screw up on the task in question, this is not the focus type for you. Anxiety and doubt undermine promotion motivation, leaving you less likely to take any action at all. What you need is a way of looking at what you need to do that isn't undermined by doubt but rather, ideally, thrives on it. When you have a prevention focus, instead of thinking about how you can end up better off, you see the task as a way to hang on to what you already have-to avoid loss. For the prevention focused, successfully completing a project is a way to keep your boss from being angry or thinking less of you. Working out regularly is a way to not \"let yourself go.\" Decades of research, which I describe in my book Focus, shows that prevention motivations is actually enhanced by anxiety about what might go wrong. When you are focused on avoiding loss, it becomes clear that the only way to get out of danger is to take immediate action. The more worried you are, the faster you are out of the gate.",
    "comments": "The passage doesn't say whether one is better, so I'm assuming they're equal. You can look at tasks like working out as \"Let's go get big\", or \"Don't let yourself recede\".

If my boss doesn't mention my request for a raise at our meeting, then I will bring it up again before the meeting ends.

Or Can this wait till later? Or Maybe I should do something else instead. It's when we deliberate that willpower becomes necessary to make the tough choice. If-then plans dramatically reduce the demands placed on your willpower by ensuring that you've made the right decision way ahead of the critical moment.

To activate PCD, you choose a low-key activity such as knitting, gardening, or casual reading, then wander into the recesses of your mind. But unlike slipping into a daydream or guilty-dysphoric daydreaming, you might first imagine something playful and wishful-like running through the woods, or lying on a yacht. Then you swivel your attention from the external world to the internal space of your mind with this image in mind while still doing the low-key activity. PCD activates the DMN and metaphorically changes the silverware that your brain uses to find information. ",

Given a test in which they had to come up with as many uses as possible for any object (such as a brick), those who behaved like eccentric poets had superior creative performance. This finding holds even if the same person takes on a different identity. When you're in a creative deadlock, try embodying a different identity.

I thought you had value, so I looked at you, and it turns out you don't so I'm dismissing you (and so looking away). In this case the person who gave the look keeps all the power and status, and the party is not looking so good for you after all. 2. You caught me looking at you, and now you have power because you know that I think you have value; but to keep control of the power and hold on to my high status, I'm taking away my look. This is our hard-to-get scenario. 3. I wanted to give you power by making sure you saw me looking at you, and now I'm looking away.

Increasingly, we use these terms to describe people who are simply full of themselves, regardless of whether their real achievements are spectacular. Outstanding performers are not always modest, but nor are they necessarily grandiose. Muhammad Ali boasted, \"I am the greatest!\" but that was no lie. He was! The primary requirement for narcissism in a clinical sense is self-absorption, a grandiose sense of self but a serious miscalculation of one's abilities and potential greatness. It's perhaps the difference between being optimistic and totally unrealistic. Additionally, the narcissist is so convinced of their high station that they expect others to recognize their superior qualities immediately. they will be comfortable and buoyant in environments in which the fantasy will not be questioned. Finally, the narcissist fails to recognize when their aggrandizement affects the comfort of others. Muhammad Ali was never unaware of the fact that his boasting really annoyed his opponents.",

Mehrabian never claimed you could view a movie in a foreign language and accurately guess 93 percent of the content by watching body language, nor is he implying that words are unimportant for getting across meaning. His research was focused on the communication of emotions, specifically liking and disliking. The nonverbal aspect of communication won't deliver 93 percent of your entire message, but it will stimulate theories in the viewer as to the underlying feelings and intentions that inform the meaning of the spoken content. People will evaluate most of the emotional content of your message not by what you say but by your nonverbal signals.",

Use relaxed body language, meaning calm and steady movement, steady breathing, light eyebrows and eyes. Sit and breathe in through your nose and then gently out through your mouth. Try to count each breath, in and out, for a count of four or five seconds. You want to assert steady, light and calm actions to attempt to draw their state away from a downward spiral. Avoid body language that is diametrically opposed to what they are doing, which may make you look as if you lack empathy and understanding.

While gazing may sometimes indicate romantic intention, the ownership signals clearly show intention. Ownership signals involve closing the proximity between yourself and the thing or person you want to have power over by either leaning in toward them close enough to touch or by touching them and physically bringing them into your own territory. Touching with the hands can show care and can look sensual; this touching involves feeling with the palm of the hand things or people you would like to bring into your personal space and be close to and care for. Witnessing these ownership signals in this scenario would seem to confirm an initial assumption that your crush is into your friend.",

Adaptors-actions we make when adapting to environments or circumstances that we are not aware we are making, like hair twisting or pulling an earlobe; these gestures may unintentionally tell something to onlookers about how we are feeling    Kinesics communicate specific meanings with body language; certain elements are universally understood to have the same meanings, and others are culturally specific.",

If you or a family member are going through a strong emotion, then move yourself or them away from the immediate environment for just ten minutes.

Look for whether they distance themselves from the hot spots of the story, split hairs when challenged on the elements of the narrative, decline to answer questions, change the subject or tone, protest a question, stall on getting to a point by giving extraneous information or are unable to recount the story out of chronological sequence. Also you can be linguistically tipped off when they direct you toward exterior social qualifiers: \"Ask anyone about it,\" they might say-or they might try to give a character reference for themselves by putting the focus onto you, saying you know they would never do such a thing, or measuring probabilities by saying they are not likely to do that. These linguistic alarm bells avoid the test of questions that are clearly answerable with a \"yes\" or \"no\" and instead use other negatives, such as \"I never do that.\"",

    "description": "Try immediately taking up more physical space. First off, sit up straight. If you are at a table, move your chair back six inches so you are taking up more room and showing off more of a physical presence to others at the table. Place your hands on the table so you are taking up that territory as well. Place your smartphone on the table and push it away from you to take up even more territory and also to keep yourself from reaching for it and hiding away with it. Stand up when you are speaking or making important points. Make eye contact with the other members of your family. All these postures will make you appear more assertive. However, if you are concerned about looking aggressive as opposed to assertive, avoid putting your hands on your hips or putting both hands on the table and leaning over in close proximity to others. These gestures are both easily taken as an overt display of upper body strength and so could misrepresent you as aggressive, getting you further dismissed or shut down by our family. You may have a better chance of being heard and listened to if you engage with the clan by commanding some space in a calm and assertive manner, without appearing aggressive.",

Additionally, lowering the gaze could signal guilt or submission to power. All in all, you are getting mixed messages or an incongruity in their nonverbal messages.

There have to be shameless people in the world. This is one of them. The same for someone vicious or untrustworthy, or with any other defect. Remembering that the whole class has to exist will make you more tolerant of its members. Another useful point to bear in mind: What qualities has nature given us to counter that defect? As an antidote to unkindness it gave us kindness. And other qualities to balance other flaws. ... And how does it injure you anyway? You'll find that none of the people you're upset about has done anything that could do damage to your mind. But that's all that \"harm\" or \"injury\" could mean. Yes, boorish people do boorish things. What's strange or unheard-of about that? Isn't it yourself you should reproach--for not anticipating that they'd act this way? ... So when you call someone \"untrustworthy\" or \"ungrateful,\" turn the reproach on yourself. It was you who did wrong. By assuming that someone else with those traits deserved your trust. Or by doing them a favor and expecting something in return, instead of looking to the action itself for your reward. What else did you expect from helping someone out? Isn't it enough that you've done what your nature demands? You want a salary for it too? As if your eyes expected a reward for seeing, or your feet for walking. That's what they were made for.

I'm not doing enougth at work or at home becomes I'm having the thought that I'm not doing enough at work or at home. Similarly, My coworker is wrong-he makes me so angry becomes I'm having the thought that my coworker is wrong, and I'm feeling anger. Labelling allows you to see your thoughts and feelings for what they are: transient sources of data that may or may not prove helpful. Humans are psychologically able to take this helicopter view of private experiences, and mounting scientific evidence shows that simple, straightforward mindulness practice like this not only improves behavior and well-being but also promotes beneficial biological changes in the brain and at the cellular level.",

Both groups were given an engagingly written description of a half-inning game. Later, the devoted fans were much better able to recall the events that mattered more to the game's outcome--advancing runners, preventing runs scored, and so on. The casual observers tended to remember colorful but irrelevant details, such as the crowd's mood and the weather. The fans' high-level knowledge of the game provided a framework on which to hang the information they had read. That finding applies generally: Top performers understand their field at a higher level than average performers do, and thus have a superior structure for remembering information about it.",

    "description": "Even brains can be changed. When kids start practicing a musical instrument, their brains develop differently--the cerebral cortex changes. Brain regions that hear tones and control fingers take over more territory, and the younger the age at which a person starts practicing, the greater the effect. The brain's ability to change is greatest in youth, but it doesn't end there. A study of London taxi drivers, who train rigorously for two years on average, found that their brains had grown in the areas that govern spatial navigation. Particularly important in such changes seems to be the buildup of a substance called myelin around nerve fibers and neurons, which work better with more myelin around them. The brains of professional pianists, for example, show increased myelination in relevant areas. It's significant that myelination is a slow process. Building up myelin over a nerve fiber that controls, say, hitting a particular piano key in a particular way involves sending the appropriate signal through that fiber over and over. This process of building up myelin by sending signals through nerve fibers, which occurs in purely intellectual fields like business as well as in sports and music, needs to happen millions of times in the development of a great performer. In other words, the process of myelin development seems an exact parallel to how deliberate practice works, and illustrates in a new way why it takes many years of intensive work to become a top performer. Research on myelin is still in its early stages, but it appears possible that at the most fundamental, molecular level, myelin may be the connection between intense practice and great performance.",

In research, the poorest performers don't set goals at all; they're just slog through their work. Mediocre performers set goals that are general and are often focused on simply achieving a good outcome--win the order; close out my positions at a profit; get the new project proposal done. The best performers set goals that are not about the outcome but about the process of reaching the outcome. Form example, instead of just winning the order, their goal might be to focus especially hard on discerning the customer's unstated needs.... But within the activity, the best performers are focused on how they can get better at some specific element of the work, just as a pianist may focus on improving a particular passage. With a goal set, the next prework step is planning how to reach the goal. Again, the best performers make the most specific, technique-oriented plans. They're thinking of exactly, not vaguely, how to get to where they're going.... You may be thinking that figuring out specific goals and plans for what you'll be doing every day sounds hard. It is, and doing it consistently requires high motivation. Where does it come from?

Falling down in figure skating means landing on your behind, protected only by a thin costume, on hard, cold ice. A few moments with a calculator tell us that by an extremely conservative estimate, Arakawa's road to the gold medal involved at least twenty thousand derriere impacts on an unforgiving surface. But they paid off. The results included Olympic gold, national adoration, and suddenly fashionable use of \"Ina Bauer\" as a vogue word throughout Japan.",

Which is why a popular trick from dieting might be helpful. Some diets allow a \"cheat day\"--one day per week in which dieters can eat anything and everything they want. Indeed, they're encouraged to write a list during the week of all the foods they craved so they can enjoy them all at once as a treat (the thinking being that if you're eating healthy six out of seven days, you're still ahead). At first, this sounds like a dream, but anyone who has actually done this knows the truth: each cheat day you eat yourself sick and hate yourself afterward. Soon enough, you're willingly abstaining from cheating at all. Because you don't need it, and you definitely don't want it. It's not unlike a parent catching her child with cigarettes and forcing them to smoke the whole pack. It's important to connect the so-called temptation with its actual effects.

The mind and the body are there to be used--they begin to turn on themselves when not put to some productive end. It's sad to think that this kind of frustration is an everyday reality for a lot of people. They leave so much of their potential unfulfilled because they have jobs where they don't really do much or because they have too much time on their hands. Worse is when we try to push these feelings away by buying things, going out, fighting, creating drama--indulging in the empty calories of existence instead of finding the real nourishment. The solution is simple and, thankfully, always right at hand. Get out there and work.",

Doing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that's exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice demands. Instead of doing what we're good at, we insistently seek out what we're not good at. Then we identify the painful, difficult activities that will make us better and do those things over and over. After each repetition, we force ourselves to see--or get others to tell us--exactly what still isn't right so we can repeat the most painful and difficult parts of what we've just done. We continue that process until we're mentally exhausted. Ericsson and his colleagues stated it clearly in their article: Deliberate practice \"is not inherently enjoyable.\" If it seems a bit depressing that the most important thing you can do to improve performance is no fun, take consolation in this fact: It must be so. If the activities that lead to greatness were easy and fun, then everyone would do them and they would not distinguish the best from the rest. The reality that deliberate practice is hard can even be seen as good news. It means that most people won't do it. So your willingness to do it will distinguish you all the more.",

    "description": "Unresolved conflicts. Colonel Stas Preczewski, coach of the army crew team at West Point a few years ago, faced a baffling problem. Through extensive testing he had determined the strengths and abilities of every rower on his team. He had measured each man's power on ergometers and had composed crews in every possible combination in order to calculate each member's contribution. He was able to rank his rowers objectively and precisely from best to worst. He then put the eight best in his varsity boat and the eight others, the weakest, in the junior varsity boat. The problem: The JV boat beat the varsity boat two-thirds of the time. The situation is explained in a famous Harvard Business School case, which also notes that the varsity boat was full of resentment over who was contributing the most, while the JV rowers, feeling they had nothing to lose, supported one another happily. But the case doesn't tell how Coach Preczewski solved his problem. One day he lined up the varsity crew in fours pairs. He told them they were to wrestle for ninety seconds. Only rule: no punching. \"It was like the WWF.\" he recalls. When he stopped them, he noticed that no one was winning. Each man was discovering that his opponent was just as strong and determined as he was. Preczewski then had them change opponents and wrestle again. By the third round they were choosing their own opponents--\"One guy would point at another and say, 'You!'\" Preczewski says. On the fourth or fifth round, one of the rowers started laughing, and they all piled into a general brawl. Eventually someone said, \"Coach, can we go row now?\" From then on the varsity boat flew and made it to the semifinals in the national tournament.",

    "description": "The other step, giving people the freedom to innovate, is a matter of motivation. The topic of why people put themselves through the rigors required for great performance is discussed in the last chapter, but it's worth noting there that on creative tasks in particular, some research suggests that people perform more innovatively when they are offered no extrinsic rewards; offering them a reward can actually reduce their creativity. Not all the research agrees, but the point is intuitively plausible: People who are internally driven to create do seem more creative than those who are just doing it for the money. As we've seen, money is never at the top of the list of motivators anyway, and when we're asking people to become masters of their field, we want to rely on the strongest possible inducements. ",

David N. Perkins of Harvard, surveying the many factors that have been proposed as important elements of creativity, wrote, \"The clearest evidence of all demonstrates the connection between creative thinking and values broadly construed-- a person's commitments and aspirations ... Much more than we usually suppose, creating is an intentional endeavor.\" Wanting to achieve mastery of a field, commiting to the long, hard work of achieving it, and then intending to innovate-- that's how it happens.",

    "description": "\"Success comes to the lowly and to the poorly talented, but the special characteristics of a great person is to triumph over the disasters and panics of human life.\" Perhaps you know people who've been extraordinarily lucky in life. Maybe they hit the genetic lottery or have skated through classes and careers with ease. Despite never planning, making reckless decisions, jumping from one thing to the next, they've somehow survived without a scratch. There's a saying: \"God favors fools.\" It's natural to be a bit envious of these folks. We want the easy life too--or so we think. But is the easy life really that admirable? Anyone can get lucky. There's no skill in being oblivious, and no one would consider that greatness. On the other hand, the person who perseveres through difficulties, who keeps going when others quit, who makes it to their destination through hard work and honesty? That's admirable, because their survival was the result of fortitude and resilience, not birthright or circumstance. A person who overcame not just the external obstacles to success but mastered themselves and their emotions along the way? That's much more impressive. The person who has been dealt a harder hand, understood it, but still triumphed? That's greatness.",

Close your eyes, relax, and sit upright. Place your full focus on your breath. Simply maintain an ongoing flow of attention on the experience of your breathing: Ihale, exhale; inhale, exhale. To help your focus stay on your breathing, count silently at each exhalation. Any time you find your mind distracted, simply release the distraction by returing your focus to your breath. Most important, allow yourself to enjoy these minutes. Throughout the rest of the day, other people and competing urgencies will fight for your attention.

Continually seeking exactly those elements of performance that are unsatisfactory and then trying one's hardest to make them better places enormous strains on anyone's mental abilities. A finding that is remarkably consistent across disciplines is that four or five hours a day seems to be the upper limit of deliberate practice, and this is frequently accomplished in sessions lasting no more than an hour to ninety minutes. The best violinists in the Berlin study, for example, practiced about three and a half hours a day, typically in two or three sessions. Even elite athletes say the factor that limits their practice time is their ability to sustain concentration. ... \"Practice with your fingers and you need all day.

That's why this belief is tragically constraining. Everyone who has achieved exceptional performance has encountered terrible difficulties along the way. There are no exceptions. If you believe that doing the right kind of work can overcome the problems, then you have at least a chance of moving on to ever better performance. But those who see setbacks as evidence that they lack the necessary gift will give up-- quite logically, in light of their beliefs. They will never achieve what they might have. What you really believe about the source of great performance thus becomes the foundation of all you will ever achieve. As we noted much earlier, such beliefs can be extremely deep-seated. Regardless of where our beliefs in this matter originated, however, we all have the opportunity to base them on the evidence of reality. The evidence offers no easy assurances. It shows that the price of top-level achievement is extraordinarily high. Perhaps it's inevitable that not many people will choose to pay it. But the evidence shows also that by understanding how a few become great, anyone can become better. Above all, what the evidence shouts most loudly is striking, liberating news: that great performance is not reserved for a preordained few. It is available to you and to everyone.",

For if we don't do this, virtue, which is strengthened only by exercising our perceptions, will no longer endure in us.\" Watching other people succeed is one of the toughest things to do--especially if we are not doing well ourselves. In our hunter-gatherer minds, suspect that life is a zero-sum game--that for someone to have more means that we might end up with less. But like all parts of philosophy, empathy and selflessness are a matter of practice. As Seneca observed, it's possible to learn to \"rejoice in all their successes and be moved by their very failure.\" This is what a virtuous person does. They teach themselves to actively cheer for other people--even in cases where that might come at their own expense--and to put aside jealousy and possessiveness. You can do that too.",

Maybe they got into Oxford or Harvard because of their parents. And what about a young person who hasn't had time to build a track record? Are they worthless? Of course not. This is why character is a far better measure of a man or woman. Not just for jobs, but for friendships, relationships, for everything. Heraclitus put it as a maxim: \"Character is fate.\" When you seek to advance your own position in life, character is the best lever--perhaps not in the short term, but certainly over the long term.

Which of these is easiest to change: our opinion or the event that is past? The answer is obvious. Accept what happened and change your wish that it had not happened. Stoicism calls this the \"art of acquiescence\"--to accept rather than fight every little thing. And the most practiced Stoics take it a step further. Instead of simply accepting what happens, they urge us to actually enjoy what has happened--whatever it is. Nietzsche, many centuries later, coined the perfect expression to capture this idea: amor fati (a love of fate). It's not just accepting, it's loving everything that happens. To wish for what has happened to happen is a clever way to avoid disappointment because nothing is contrary to your desires. But to actually feel gratitude for what happens? To love it?

    "description": "In undergoing a twelve-step program, many addicts struggle most with step 2: acknowledging a higher power. Addicts often fight this one. At first they claim it's because they're atheists or because they don't like religion or because they don't undestand why it matters. But they later realize that this is just the addiction talking--it's another form of selfishness and self-absorption. The actual language of the step is pretty easy to swallow: \"[We] came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.\" Subsequent steps ask the addict to submit and let go. The second step really has less to do with \"god\" than those other steps--the letting go. It's about attuning to the universe and discarding the toxic idea that we're at the center of it. It's no wonder that the Stoics are popular with those in twelve-step programs. It's also clear that this wisdom is beneficial to us all. You don't have to believe there is a god directing the universe, you just need to stop believing that you're the director. As soon as you can attune your spirit to that idea, the easier and happier your life will be, because you will have given up the most potent addiction of all: control.",

The answer is that the human possessed something the computer didn't, which was vast knowledge of chess--how previous masters had responded to particular positions in many different cases, and what kinds of choices generally produced what kinds of consequences. Eventually researchers from a broad array of fields realized where the secret lay. \"The most important ingredient in any expert system is knowledge,\" wrote three eminent scientists who work on expert computer systems (Bruce G. Buchanan, Randall Davis, and Edward A. Feigenbaum). \"Programs that are rich in general inference methods--some of which may even have some of the power of mathematical logic--but poor in domain-specific knowledge can behave expertly on almost no tasks.\" Their conclusion: \"In the knowledge resides the power.\" ... Part of the answer, which seems to apply in every domain, is that they had more knowledge about their field. In chess, researchers have found (using a method I'll describe a little later) that master-level players possess more chess knowledge than good club-level players by a huge margin, a factor of ten to one hundred. Just as important, top performers in a wide range of fields have better organized and consolidated their knowledge, enabling them to approach problems in fundamentally different and more useful ways.",

They aren't using short-term memory or traditionally defined long-term memory. ... Other researchers have called it expert working memory. To understand its critical element, remember the story of SF, the yelling runner who was able to recall extraordinarily long lists of random digits. He did it by relating the digits to numbers in forms that were meaningful to him; for example, he recalled the digits 4 1 3 1 in the form 4:13.1, a time for running the mile.

When they returned to the lab after two weeks, their scores on the self-control tests went up, and the improvement was significantly higher by comparison with a control group (which did no exercises of any kind during the two weeks). This was a striking result, and with careful analyses of the data, the conclusions, became clearer and stronger. Unexpectedly, the best results came from the group working on their posture. That tiresome old advice--\"Sit up straight!\" --was more useful than anyone had imagined. By overriding their habit of slouching, the students strengthened their willpower and did better at tasks that had nothing to do with posture. The improvement was most pronounced among the students who had followed the advice most diligently (as measured by the daily logs the students kept of how often they'd forced themselves to sit up or stand up straight). The experiment also revealed an important distinction in self-control between two kinds of strength: power and stamina. At the first lab session, participants began by squeezing a spring-loaded handgrip for as long as they could (which had been shown in other experiments to be a good measure of willpower, not just physical strength). Then, after expending mental energy through the classic try-not-to-think-of-a-white-bear task, they did a second hand-grip task to assess how they fared when willpower was depleted. Two weeks later, when they returned to the lab after working on their posture, their scores on the initial handgrip tests didn't show much improvement, meaning that the willpower muscle hadn't gotten more powerful. But they had much more stamina, as evidenced by their improved performance on the subsequent handgrip test administered after the researchers tried to fatigue them. Thanks to the students' posture exercises, their willpower didn't get depleted as quickly as before, so they had more stamina for other tasks.",

The page-a-day folks had done well and generally gotten tenure. The so-called \"binge writers\" fared far less well, and many had had their careers cut short. The clear implication was that the best advice for young writers and aspiring professors is: Write every day. Use your self-control to form a daily habit, and you'll produce more with less effort in the long run.",

    "description": "Long before children can read rules or do chores, they can start learning self-control. Ask any parent who has survived the ordeal of Ferberization, which is based on a technique found in a Victorian child-rearing manual. It requires the parents, against all instinct, to ignore their infants' cries when they're left alone at bedtime. Instead of rushing to the infant's side, the parents let the infant cry for a fixed interval of time, then go offer some comfort, then withdraw for another fixed interval. The process is repeated until the child learns to control the crying and go to sleep without any help from the parents. It requires great self-control by the parents to ignore the heart-rending screams, but the infant usually learns quickly to put themselves to sleep without any crying. Once an infant acquires self-control, everybody wins: The infant is no longer anxious at bedtime or when he or she wakes up alone in the middle of the night, and the parents don't have to spend their nights hovering by the crib. We've seen parents successfully use a variant of this approach when an infant cries to be fed. Instead of immediately feeding the crying child, the mother lets the child know that the signal has been received but then waits for him or her to quiet down before offering the breast or the botte. Again, it's hard to ignore the cries at first, and we realize that to some parents it sounds too cruel to even try. But once a child learns to ask for food without going into a crying frenzy, both child and parent end up calmer and happier. The children are learning that they have some power over themselves, that certain kinds of behaviour are expected, and that actions have consequences--lessons that will become more and more important as they get older.",

Suddenly the Celestial City seems much less important than this one little building. And thus, verily, our pilgrim's progress endeth with him passed out on the pub's floor.

Fear is generally regarded as bad. To a Stoic like Hecato (known as Hecato of Rhodes), they are the same--both are projections into the future about things we do not control. Both are the enemy of this present moment that you are actually in. Both mean you're living a life in opposition to amor fati. It's not about overcoming our fears but understanding that both hope and fear contain a dangerous amount of want and worry in them. And sadly, the want is what causes the worry.",

It's almost futile because they accomplish nothing. Instead, understand what you can control and focus on that. Because that is what moves you forward.

The children with good self-control were much more likely to wind up in a stable marriage and raise children in a two-parent home. Last, but certainly not least, the children with poor self-control were likely to end up in prison. Among those with the lowest levels of self-control, more than 40 percent had a criminal conviction by the age of thirty-two, compared with just 12 percent of the people who had been toward the high end of the self-control distribution of their youth. Not surprisingly, some of these differences, were correlated with intelligence and social class and race--but all these results remained significant even when those factors were taken into account. In a follow-up study, the same researchers looked at brothers and sisters from the same families so that they could compare children who grew up in similar homes. Again, over and over, the sibling with the lower self-control during childhood fared worse during adulthood. They ended up sicker, poorer, and were more likely to spend time in prison.

Instead, children have preferred games in which they start out as lowly \"noob\" (as in newbies) who must earn respect through their accomplishments. To acquire skills, they fail over and over. The typical teenager must have endured thousands of digital deaths and virtual fiascos, yet somehow he retains enough self-esteem to keep trying. While parents and educators have been promoting the everybody-gets-a-trophy philosophy, children have been seeking games with more demanding standards. Players need concentration to fight off Ork after Ork; they need patience to mine for virtual gold; they need thriftiness to save up for a new sword or helmet. Instead of bemoaning the games' hold over children, we should be exploiting the techniques that game designers have developed. They've refined the basic steps of self-control: setting clear and attainable goals, giving instantaneous feedback, and offering enough encouragement for people to keep practicing and improving. After noticing how hard people work at games, some pioneers are pursuing the \"gamification\" of life by adapting these techniques (like establishing \"quests\" and allowing people to \"level up\") for schools and workplaces and digital collaborations. Video games give new glamour to old-fashioned virtues. Success is conditional--but it's within your reach as long as you have the discipline to try, try again.",

Their resigned attitude might seem strange to us today, but they understood who was really in control (not them, not us!). No amount of prosperity, no amount of difficulty, is certain or forever.

The name of that thing is Attachment.\" Attachments to an image you have of a person, attachments to wealth and status, attachments to a certain place or time, attachments to a job or to a lifestyle. All of those things are dangerous for one reason: they are outside of our reasoned choice. How long we keep them is not in our control. As Epictetus realized some two thousand years ago before de Mello, our attachments are what make it so hard to accept change. Once we have them, we don't want to let go. We become slaves to maintaining the status quo. We are like the Red Queen in Alice and Wonderland--running faster and faster to stay in the same place. But everything is in a constant state of change. We have certain things for a while then lose them. The only permanent thing is prohairesis, our capacity for reasoned choice. The things we are attached to can come and go, our choice is resilient and adaptable. The sooner we become aware of this the better. The easier it will be to accept and adapt to what does happen.",

By considering it and meditating on it in advance. And this is true not just for our day-to-day adversities but for the greatest and most unavoidable trial of all: our own eventual death. It could come tomorrow, it could come in forty years. It could be quick and painless, or it could be excruciating.

In John Fante's Ask the Dust (part of a series known as The Bandini Quartet), this young writer doesn't experience the life he is living, he sees it all \"across a page in a typewriter,\" wondering if nearly every second of his life is a poem, a play, a story, a news article with him as its main character. In Walker Percy's The Moviegoer, his protagonist, Binx, is addicted to watching movies, preferring an idealized version of life on the screen to his own uncomfortable ennui....Because sadly, this trait, the inability to get out of one's head, is not restricted to fiction. Twenty-four hundred years ago, Plato spoke of the type of people who are guilty of \"feasting on their own thoughts.\" It was apparently common enough even then to find people who \"instead of finding out how something they desire might actually come about, [they] pass that over, so as to avoid tiring deliberations about what's possible They assume that what they desire is available and proceed to arrange the rest, taking pleasure in thinking through everything they'll do when they have what they want, thereby making their lazy souls even lazier.\" Real people preferring to live in passionate fiction than in actual reality.",

Pride leads to arrogance and then away from humility and connection with their fellow man. You don't have to be Christian to see the wisdom in this. You need only to care about your career to understand that pride--even in real accomplishments--is a distraction and a deluder. \"Whom the gods wish to destroy,\" Cyril Connolly famously said, \"they first call promising.\" Twenty-five hundred years before that, the elegiac poet Theognis wrote to his friend, \"The first thing, Kurnos, which gods bestow on one they would annihilate, is pride.\" Yet we pick up this mantle on purpose! Pride blunts the very instrument we need to own in order to succeed: our mind. Our ability to learn, to adapt, to be flexible, to build relationships, all of this is dulled by pride. Most dangerously, this tends to happen either early in life or in the process--when we're flushed with beginner's conceit. Only later do you realize that that bump on the head was the least of what was risked. Pride takes a minor accomplishment and makes it feel like a major one. It smiles at our cleverness and genius, as though what we've exhibited was merely a hint of what ought to come. From the start, it drives a wedge between the possessor and reality, subtly and not so subtly changing her perceptions of what something is and what it isn't. It is these strong opinions, only loosely secured by fact or accomplishment, that send us careering toward delusion or worse.",

Later, when Soo went off to college and asked her parents for a cheap used car to get around, they refused but offered to buy her a brand-new car if she was admitted to medical school.

It satisfies the craving to some degree--and can be even more effective at suppressing the appetite than actually eating the treat. During the final part of the experiment, when all the people were left alone with a bowl of M&M's, the ones who'd postponed pleasure ate even less than the people who had earlier allowed themselves to eat the candy at will. Moreover, the suppression effect seemed to last outside the laboratory. The day after the experiment, all the people were sent an e-mail with the question: \"How much do you desire M&M candies at this very moment, if someone offered them to you?\" Those who had postponed gratification reported less desire to eat the candy than either people who had refused the pleasure outright or those who had eaten their fill. It takes willpower to turn down dessert, but apparently it's less stressful on the mind to say Later rather than Never. In the long run, you end up wanting less and also consuming less.... Ordinarily, people will pay more for an immediate pleasure, but in this case they were willing to spend extra money to postpone the kiss, because it would let them spend three days savoring the prospect. Similarly, delaying the gratification of creme brulee or molten chocolate cake gives time to enjoy the anticipation. As a result of that advance pleasure, when you ultimately do indulge, you may find less of a need to binge and more of an inclination to eat moderately.

    "description": "The best way to reduce stress in your life is to stop screwing up. That means setting up your life so that you have a realistic chance to succeed. Successful people don't use their willpower as a last-ditch defense to stop themselves from disaster, at least not as a regular strategy, as Baumeister and his colleagues have observed recently on both sides of the Atlantic. When they monitored Germans throughout the day (in the beeper study we mentioned earlier), the researchers were surprised to find that the people with strong self-control spent less time resisting desires than other people did.... They're better at arranging their lives so that they avoid problem situations.... people with good self-control mainly use it not for rescue in emergencies but rather develop effective habits and routines in school and at work....They use their self-control not to get through crises but to avoid them. They give themselves enough time to finish a project; they take the car to the shop before it breaks down; they stay away from all-you-can-eat buffets. They play offense instead of defense.",
    "comments": "Set up your life for a realistic chance to succeed. You can't win if you're stuck in bed all day. You'll succumb to jerking off. You need to create a plan that keeps you away. People with high self-control don't exert willpower to avoid desire because they've designed around it. Play offense. Go chase life, don't let it chase you around. You don't want to spend all of your efforts on defense. That's exhausting.",

    "description": "The Nothing Alternative is a marvelously simple tool against procrastination for just about any kind of task. Although your work may not be as solitary and clearly defined as Chandler's, you can still benefit by setting aside time to do one and only one thing. You might, for instance, resolve to start your day with ninety minutes devoted to your most important goal, with no interruptions from e-mail or phone calls, no side excursions anywhere on the Web. Just follow Chandler's regimen: \"Write or nothing. It's the same principle as keeping order in a school. If you make the pupils behave, they will learn something just to keep from being bored. I find it works. Two very simple rules, a. you don't have to write. b. you can't do anything else. The rest comes of itself.\" The rest comes of itself. That's the seeming effortlessness that comes from playing offense. Chandler was incorporating several of the techniques we discussed earlier. The Nothing Alternative is a bright-line rule: a clear, unmistakeable boundary, like the no-drinking vow.  -- If I can't write, I will do nothing -- is also an example of an implementation plan, that specific if-x-then-y strategy that has been shown to reduce the demands on willpower.",

To forestall panic, she avoids the stress of the mall and returns home. But now the anxiety systems in her brain note that she ran away from the mall, and conclude that the journey there way truly dangerous. Our anxiety systems are very practical. They assume that anything you run away from is dangerous. The proof of that is, of course, the fact you ran away. So now the mall is tagged \"too dangerous to approach\" (or the budding agoraphobic has labelled herself, \"too fragile to approach the mall\").",

Avoiding women and other things like talking to other people or applying for a job will get worse if you avoid them. Instead, tackling your fears head on is the surest way to overcome them. Not by reading about it, but by being present in that moment.",

He could have become resentful and bitter. His life had been rendered miserable by both Stalin and Hitler, two of the worst tyrants in history. He lived in brutal conditions. Vast stretches of his precious time were stolen from him and squandered. He witnessed the pointless and degrading suffering and death of his friends and acquaintances. Then he contracted an extremely serious disease. Solzhenitsyn had cause to curse God. Job himself barely had it as hard. But the great writer, the profound, spirited defender of truth, did not allow his mind to turn towards vengeance and destruction. He opened his eyes, instead. During his many trials, Solzhenitsyn encountered people who comported themselves nobly, under horrific circumstances. ... Can I stop making such mistakes, now? Can I repair the damage done by my past failures, now? He learned to watch and listen. He found people he admired; who were honest, despite everything. He took himself apart, piece by piece, let what was unneccessary and harmful die, and resurected himself. ... One man's decision to change his life, instead of cursing fate, shook the whole pathological system of communist tyranny to its core.",

The much larger man grabs him by the arm and says, \"Listen here. I'd smash your face. . . . Only you're so skinny you might dry up and blow away.\" The bully departs. Mac says to the girl, \"The big bully I'll get him some day.\" She adopts a provocative pose, and says, \"Oh, don't let it bother you little boy.\" Mac goes home, considers his pathetic physique, and buys the Atlas program. Soon, he has a new body. The next time he goes to the beach, he punches the bully in the nose.

    "description": "On many occasions in our nearly thirty years of marriage my wife and I have had a disagreement--sometimes a deep disagreement. Our unity appeared to be broken, at some unknowably profound level, and we were not able to easily resolve the rupture by talking. We became trapped, instead, in emotional, angry and anxious argument. We agreed that when such circumstances arose we would separate, briefly: she to one room, me to another. This was often quite difficult, because it is hard to disengage in the heat of an argument, when anger generates the desire to defeat and win. But it seemed better than risking the consequences of a dispute that threatened to spiral out of control. Alone, trying to calm down, we would each ask ourselves the same single question: What had we each done to contribute to the situation we were arguing about? However small, however distant . . . we had each made some error. Then we would reunite, and share the results of our questioning: Here's how I was wrong. . . . The problem with asking yourself such a question is that you must truly want the answer. ... But it's at such a point that you must decide wheter you want to be right or you want to have peace. ... You don't get peace by being right.",
    "comments": "It's hard to disengage from an argument, when anger is high and you want to \"win\". You should separate so the anger can settle. Do you want to be right? Or do you want peace? Wait out the emotion.",

You can ask a woman how her day is going, or say the most perceptive and witty thing to her in the first minutes, but her first impression is largely going to be based on how you persent yourself (looks/lifestyle), your level of anxiety, and your ability to communicate clearly.

This may be outside your comfort zone, but realize that in the bedroom the rules change and logic goes out the window. 3. Get physical. Spank her. Pull her hair. Hold her down with one hand. When you change positions, literally pick her up and move her yourself. 4. Don't ever ask, \"Is this OK? Do you want to do X?\" Just do it and stop later if she doesn't like it and apologize.

With the fans and cooling systems turned off, the air inside the sub was over a hundred degrees; but I was so chilled with fear that I put on a sweater and a fur-lined jacket; and still I trembled with cold. My teeth chattered. I broke out in a cold, clammy sweat. The attack continued for fifteen hours. ... Those fifteen hours of attack seemed like fifteen million years. All my life passed before me in review. I remembered all the bad things I had done, all the little absurd things I had worried about. I had been a bank clerk before I joined the Navy. I had worried about the long hours, the poor pay, the poor prospects of advancement. I had worried because I couldn't own my own home, couldn't buy a new car, couldn't buy my wife nice clothes. How I had hated my old boss, who was always nagging and scolding! I remembered how I would come home at night sore and grouchy and quarrel with my fire over trifles. I had worried about a scar on my forehead--a nasty cut from an auto accident. \"How big alll those worries seemed years ago! But how absurd they seemed when depth charges were threatening to blow me to kingdom come. I prosmised myself then and there that if I ever saw the sun and the stars again, I would never, never worry again. Never! Never! Never!!! I learned more about the art of living in those fifteen terrible hours in that submarine than I had learned by studying books for four years in Syracuse University.\"",

    "description": "Even if you are not a religious person by nature or training--even if you are an out-andout skeptic--prayer can help you much more than you believe, for it is a practicial things. What do I mean, practical? I mean that prayer fulfills these three very basic psychological needs which all people share, whether they believe in God or not: 1. Prayer helps us to put into words exactly what is troubling us. We saw in Chapter 4 that it is almost impossible to deal with a problem while it reamins vague and nebulous. Praying, in a way, is very much like writing our problems down on paper. If we ask help for a problem--even from God--we must put it into words. 2. Prayer gives us a sense of sharing our burdens, of not being alone. Few of us are so strong that we can bear our heaviest burdens, our most agonizing troubles, all by ourselves. Sometimes our worries are of so intimate a nature that we cannot discuss them even with out closest relatives or friends. Then prayer is the answer. Any psychiatrist will tell us that when we are pent-up and tense, and in an agony of spirit, it is therapeutically good to tell someone our troubles. When we can't tell anyone else--we can always tell God. 3. Prayer puts into force an active principle of doing. It's a first step toward action. I doubt if anyone can pray for some fulfillment, day after day, without benefiting from it--in other words, without taking some steps to bring it to pass. The world-famous scientist, Dr. Alexis Carrel, said: \"Prayer is the most powerful form of energy one can generate.\" So why not make use of it? Call it God or Allah or Spirit--why quarrel with definitions as long as the mysterious powers of nature take us in hand? Why not close this book right now, shut the door, kneel down, and unburden your heart? ... \"Lord, make me an instrument of Thy Peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love. Where there is injury, pardon. Where there is doubt, faith. Where there is despair, hope. Where there is darkness, light. Where there is sadness, joy. O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood, as to understand; to be loved, as to love; for it is in giving that we receive, it is in pardoning that we are pardoned, and it is in dying that we are born to Eternal Life.\"",

Stay calm, talk it out and find common ground instead. 4. Stay humble, skip the bragging. You don't need to show off. Your actions speaks volumes and staying humble earns respect. 5. Calm conversations; no yelling. Yelling doesn't solve problems. Speak calmly to be heard and understood. 6. Learn to listen; talk later. Successful people listen more than they talk. Understanding comes before sharing your thoughts. 7. Be kind, skip the judging. Instead of judging, put yourself in others' shoes. It builds empathy and better relationships. 8. Stick to the truth, skip the lies. Honesty builds trust, even when it's tough, it's the best way to go.",

I'm lazy. I don't wanna do it, It's too hard. No one else is doing it. It's a weekend. It's too late. It's already off hours. Oh, exactly what I want isn't happening right now.' Like okay, great.

It's very confusing right now because everything is so fluid and we're all supposed to think that there's no such thing as masculinity anymore, that it's toxic. But real masculinity, that real kind of strength that I'm talking about is not toxic at all. It is not out there to hurt people. It's not out there to dominate, to be aggresive, to push around people. It's all about an inner strength, an inner confidence that you radiate outward. And that's a beautiful, beautiful thing.

Remember the slogan, \"When two partners always agree, one of them is not necessary.\" If there is some point you haven't thought about, be thankful if it is brought to your attention. perhaps this disagreement is your opportunity to be corrected before you make a serious mistake. Distrust your first instinctive impression. Our first natural reaction in a disagreeable situation is to be defensive. Be careful. Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction. It may be you at your worst, not your best. Control your temper. Remember, you can measure the size of a person by what makes him or her angry. Listen first. Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Do not resist, defend or debate. This only raises barriers. Try to build bridges of understanding. Don't build higher barriers of misunderstanding. Look for areas of agreement. When you have heard your opponents out, dwell first on the points and areas on which you agree. Be honest. Look for areas where you can admit error and say so. Apologize for your mistakes. It will help disarm your opponents and reduce defensiveness. Promise to think over your opponents' ideas and study them carefully. And mean it. Your opponents may be right. It is a lot easier at this stage to agree to think about their points than to move rapidly ahead and find yourself in a position where your opponents can say: \"We tried to tell you, but you wouldn't listen.\" Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Anyone who takes the time to disagree with you is interested in the same things you are. Think of them as people who really want to help you, and you may turn your opponents into friends. Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem. Suggest that a new meeting be held later that day or the next day, when all the facts may be brought to bear. In preparation for this meeting, ask yourself some hard questions: Could my opponents be right? Partly right? Is there truth or merit in their position or argument? Is my reaction one that will relieve the problem, or will it just relieve any frustration? Will my reaction drive my opponents further away or draw them closer to me? Will my reaction elevate the estimation good people have of me? Will I win or lose? What price will I have to pay if I win? If I am quiet about it, will the disagreement blow over? Is this difficult situation an opportunity for me?",

    "description": "\"What is the biggest lesson you have ever learned?\" That was easy: by far the most vital lesson I have ever learned is the importance of what we think. If I knew what you think, I would know what you are. Our thoughts make us what we are. Our mental attitude is the X factor that determines our fate. Emerson said: \"A man is what he thinks about all day long.\" ... How could he possibly be anything else? I now know with a conviction beyond all doubt that the biggest problem you and I have to deal with--in fact, almost the only problem we have to deal with--is choosing the right thoughts. If we can do that, we will be on the highroad to solving all our problems. The great philosopher who ruled the Roman Empire, Marcus Aurelius, summed it up in eight words--eight words that can determine your destiny: \"Our life is what our thoughts make it.\" Yes, if we think happy thoughts, we will be happy. If we think miserable thoughts, we will be miserable. etc. ",

Just for today I will exercise my sould in three ways; I will do somebody a good turn and not get found out. I will do at least two things I don't want to do. as William James suggests, just for exercise. 6. Just for today I will be agreeable. I will look as well as I can, dress as becomingly as possible, talk low, act courteously, be liberal with praise, criticize not at all, nor find fault with anything and not try to regulate nor improve anyone. 7. Just for today I will try to live through this day only, not to tackle my whole life problem at once. I can do things for twelve hours that would appall me if I had to keep them up for a lifetime. 8. Just for today I will have a program. I will write down what I expect to do every hour. I may not follow it exactly, but I will have it. It will eliminate two pests, hurrying and indecision. 9. Just for today I will have a quiet half-hour all by myself and relax. In this half-hour sometimes I will think of God, so as to get a little more perspective into my life. 10. Just for today I will be unafraid, especially I will not be afraid to  be happy, to enjoy what is beautiful, to love, and to believe that those I love, love me.

There are thousands of people like her, people who are ill from \"ingratitude,\" loneliness, and neglect. They long to be loved; but the only way in this world that they can ever hope to be loved is to stop asking for it and to start pouring out love without hope of return. ... Here is the second point I am trying to make in this chapter: If we want to find happiness, let's stop thinking about gratitude or ingratitude and give for the inner joy of giving. Parents have been tearing their hair about the ingratitude of children for ten thousand years. Even Shakespeare's King Lear cried out, \"How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child!\" But why should children be thankful--unless we train them to be? Ingratitude is natural--like weeds. Gratitude is like a rose. It has to be fed and watered and cultivated and loved and protected. If our children are ungrateful, who is to blame? Maybe we are. If we have never taught them to express gratitude to others, how can we expect them to be grateful to us?",

    "description": "I started taking classes at UC Berkeley. I took several classes, but the only one I can remember was a sailing class taught at Berkeley marina. When my class was over I wanted to buy a sailboat. My wife said this was the single stupidest idea she had ever heard in her entire life. She accused me of being irresponsible and she told me I lacked ambition. She kicked me out, and then she divorced me. My family was still mad at me for not going to medical school, and now my wife was divorcing me because I lacked ambition. It looked like a reoccurence of the same old problem. Once again, I was unable to live up to the expactations of others. I was not disappointed in myself for failing to be the person they thought I should be. Their dreams, and my dreams, were different. I would never confuse the two of them again. I bought the sailboat, and lived on board. Just me and my cat in Berkeley Marina. I searched, and I searched, but I just could not find a software engineering job that I loved as much as I loved sailing. So I tried to create one. That way I could completely control my work environment. My goal was to create the perfect job for me. A job I truly loved. I never expected the company to grow beyond fifty people. So maybe I really did lack ambition, or vision back then. I don't know, it was a long time ago, and I was very young.",

Most people I've run into in my life think that the mood they're in during the day is a mood that somehow comes from within, or comes from somewhere, and that's their mood. And they say what kind of a mood I'm in today. I'm here to tell you that you get to choose your mood. You can be in any mood that you want, but you have to take the time to set the mood. And sometimes you have to stop during the day, check in on your mood, and make adjustments. My advice is when you get up in the morning, before you do anything else, take a few minutes and decide on the mood that you want to have for the day. And then during the day, check in with yourself. Say to yourself, do I have that mood that I wanted to have? No? Well, how do I make some adjustments and get myself into that mood. Your mood is up to you. It's not something that comes from out of the sky, It's not something that bubbles up from within. it's something that you develop, that you select. And when you do that, you get to choose any mood you want. And that is a wonderful gift to give yourself",

Try leaving a friendly trail of little sparks of gratitude on your daily trips. You will be surprised how they will set small flames of friendship that will be rose beacons on your next visit. [Janitor passage] Pamela ... had among her responsibilities on her job the supervision of a janitor who was doing a very poor job. The other employees would jeer at him and litter the hallways to show him what a bad job he was doing. It was so bad, productive time was being lost in the shop. Without success, Pam tried various ways to motivate this person. She noticed that occasionally he did a particularly good piece of work. She made a point to praise him for it in front of the other people. Each day the job he did all aound got better, and pretty soon he started doing all his work efficiently. Now he does an excellent job and other people give him appreciation and recognition. Honest appreciation got results where criticism and ridicule failed. Hurting people does not only change them, it is never called for. There is an old saying that I have cut out and pasted on my mirror where I cannot help but see it every day: I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.",

    "description": "The weakest men according to the Stoics, are those who cannot control their anger. In a world where every move counts, your inability to master anger is a fatal flaw, one that will forever hold you back. Because this very emotion, when left unchecked, is capable of destroying reputations, relationships, and opportunities in an instant. But, anger can also be very useful. Because when directed with precision it can be a formidable force, propelling one towards massive action to transform one's life. That's why the Stoics didn't say to ignore anger, but to master it. For the power in a man lies in how he channels anger",

And he was talking about what a success it was. Because he wasn't measuring success on getting someone to like him, he was measuring success on simply making it clear that he was interested, that he was curious to get to know someone. He made it clear this person mattered and he wanted to get to know more. And if you do that, if measure sucess not on getting someone to say yes or no but simply sharing how you feel and letting the universe unfold being okay no matter what, you're gonna meet so many people and you'll live a life that is fulfilling and much more balanced and much happier.",

I spend enough time with them to know what they like and don't like. most women want to feel safe and secure, that's it. You can love a girl, but if you never ever let them feel safe or secure around you, they will never fall for you. Never. And a good way is by validating her feelings and emotions. I never say understand her, I said validate. You want to win a girl over, you need to know how to let her feel safe. You can give her all the gifts in the world and buy her everything she wants, buts if you do not know now to let her feel safe around you and secure around you, she will never fall in love with you. My girlfriends out there right, the moment they fell in love was when the moment their boyfriend made them feel safe around them. If she tells you how she's feeling, never invalidate them don't be like \"oh my God that is crazy\" that is too serious. Do not ever say that. The moment you say that she will feel insecure to share how she feels about you. And they want to share their feelings with you because the more they share their feelings with you, the more they fall for you. You might not understand why they are feeling the way they are, it's okay. But you need to validate them. How to validate them. Repeat what they say to you back to them and never criticize them. \"Oh my God yeah I do see how that's crazy, that must be so tiring for you\". \"Oh my God babe do share more.\" Do you see how that is different from: \"You're overreacting, that's not even crazy at all.\" \"You're being psychotic right now.\" Do you see the difference? Validate how they are feeling. If you constantly tell them that they're crazy, psychotic, or whatever, they will just lose feelings. Like honestly, they would not want to share with you anymore.",

The modest way in which I propos'd my opinions procur'd them a readier reception and less contradiction; I had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily prevail'd with other to give up their mistakes and join with me when I happened to be in the right. \"And this mode, which I at first put on with some violence to natural inclination, became at length so easy, and so habitual to me, that perhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical expression from me. And to this habit (after my character of integrity) I think it principally owing that I had earned so much weight with my fellow citizens when I proposed new institutions, or alterations in the old, and so much influence in public councils when I became a member; for I was but a bad speaker, never eloquent, subject to much hesitation in my choice of words, hardly correct in language, and yet I generally carried my points.\"",

It turns out there's actually a part of your brain responsible for you willpower. It's called the anterior singulate cortex or amcc. It's one of the most connected parts of your brain and it basically helps you decide if something is worth your energy or not. Studies have shown that people with stronger willpower actually have a bigger amcc and the difference between an athlete's brain and someone who struggles with self-discipline; the athlete's amcc is way bigger. The good news is this part of your brain acts exactly like a muscle and you can make it grow. Every time you do something that you don't feel like doing, every time you resist a temptation, every time you push through discomfort you're making this part of your brain stronger, literally growing your willpowe. But if you keep giving in, hitting snooze, or putting off those small tasks, your amcc shrinks. So stop waiting for motivation to finally show up. Just start doing all the things you don't want to do and you'll be rewarded with an endless supply of grit, determination, and willpower.",

So if I find that some particular thing is causing me to have stress, that's a warning flag for me. What it means is there's something that I haven't completely identified, perhaps in my conscious mind, that is bothering me and I haven't yet taken any action on it. I find as soon as I identify it and make the first phone call or send off the first email message or whatever it is that we're gonna do to start to address that situation. Even if it's not solved, the mere fact that we're addressing it dramatically reduces any stress that might have come from it. So stress comes from ignoring things that you shouldn't be ignoring. Stress doesn't come from hard work. You could be working incredibly hard and loving it, and likewise, you can be out of work and incredibly stressed over that. If you're out of work, but you're going through a disciplined approach of a series of job interviews and so on, and working to remedy that situation, you're gonna be a lot less stressed than if you're just worrying about it and doing nothing.",

Beethoven used to take walks carrying pages of sheet music and pencil. The Romantic poet William Wordsworth used to write as he took walks around a lake where he lived. Ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle would lecture their students while taking long walks with them, often working out their ideas at the same time. Two thousand years later, the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche would say, \"It is only ideas gained from walking that have any worth.\" Einstein refined many of his theories about the universe while walking around the Princeton University campus. The writer Henry David Thoreau would say, \"The moment my legs begin to move, my thoughts begin to flow.\" ... There is a lot of evidence for the power of taking a walk to increase creativity, inspire new ideas ... A 2014 study by researchers at Stanford University showed that walking increased the creative thinking of 100 percent of the study participants ...",

    "description": "When I give commencement and keynote addresses--I'd do the same thing on the front page of my speech drafts. I knew once I got to ten reps I could do a decent job delivering the speech, but twenty reps meant I could knock it out of the park. The words would feel more natural, like I was speaking off the cuff and from the heart. The more I practiced the speech, the more of myself would be present in the room, and the more likely it would be that the people in the audience felt connected to me and the ideas I was sharing with them.",
    "comments": "When you practice a speech, you'll memorize the lines and add more of your personality because you'll spend less effort trying to remember what to say. You can focus more on the audience (outward) instead of yourself (inward). It adds confidence when you know what to say. Confidence is a big deal when selling things.",

    "description": "That's the beauty of pain. Not only is it temporary, which means you don't have to deal with it forever, it tells you whether you've begun to give enough of yourself in pursuit of your dreams. If the work of being great or achieving something special hasn't hurt or cost you anything, or at least made you uncomfortable, then I'm sorry to be the one to tell you, but you're not working hard enough. You're not sacrificing all that could be sacrificed in order to be all that you could become.",

Do you honestly think that you'll become a master at art with a thirty minute exercise every day? That's right, no. Hazelnut went through all of this. The 4am night, tears, and repetition. The viewers never saw how hard I worked for that. They only get to see the happy part at the very end. I worked so hard that some of them can't even believe how good it was. What they didn't see was the pain, long hours, and pure emptiness. That's what it takes. You must endure pain",

    "description": "Dancing is a popular metaphor for life. One must be limber and agile and go along with the music. One must feel and follow and flow with their partner. But anyone who has tried to do something difficult, where there is competition or an adversary, knows that the dancing metaphor is insufficient. Nobody ever gets up on stage and tries to tackle a dancer. The dancer never gets choked out by a rival. For a wrestler, on the other hand, adversity and the unexpected are part and parcel of what they do. Their sport is a battle, just like life. They are fighting an opponent as well as their own limitations, emotions, and training. Life, like wrestling, requires more than graceful movement. We have to undergo hard training and cultivate an indomitable will to prevail. Philosophy is the steel against which we sharpen that will and strengthen that resolve.",
