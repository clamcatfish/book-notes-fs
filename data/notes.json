    "description": "Learning to cope with discomfort--disagreement, aggression, and criticism (even wholly unprovoked aggression and criticism)--can be one of the greatest accomplishments of a child's early school years. Robert Reich, who was among other things President Bill Clinton's undersecretary of labor, attributes much of his personal development and even his later professional success to being bullied as a child. ... Reich set about finding ways to offset it. He developed his intellect, for one thing, and formed alliances with larger boys who were willing to protect him. Ultimately, being pushed around on the playground shaped Reich in a deep and lasting way, helping to strengthen his resolve to persevere and overcome. To make something of himself.",
